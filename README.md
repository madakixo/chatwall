# LoveWall - Exclusive Circle of 7

LoveWall is an interactive canvas for shared intimacy. This version features the **Circle of 7 Protocol**, ensuring high exclusivity within small groups while maintaining the magic of 1-on-1 interaction.

## How it Works: Exclusivity Protocol

- **The Group of 7**: Join a circle of exactly 7 members. 
- **The Lobby**: A shared digital space showing the status of all 7 members.
- **1-on-1 Exclusivity**: At any point, only **one pair** can enter the Private Wall.
- **Waiting Room Logic**: When a session is active, the other 5 members see a "Busy" status in the lobby and must wait for the current session to end.
- **Real-time Status**: Pulsing UI indicators show who is currently paired up.
- **AI Concierge**: Gemini AI tracks the circle's health and suggests pairings or interactions based on recent activity.

## Features

- **Draggable Multi-media Canvas**: Notes, Photos, Videos, and Stickers.
- **Live Heartbeat Audio**: Background audio presence for paired sessions.
- **Magic Moments**: AI image generation for romantic storytelling.
- **Session Control**: Easily end your session to open the wall for the next pair in the circle.

## Deployment

Deploy via Vercel or Netlify. Requires `API_KEY` (Gemini API) as an environment variable.
